                abstract: "Approximately 60% of the adult population experience at least 1 episode of epistaxis in their lifetimes. Because the blood supply of the nasal mucosa ultimately originates from the carotid arteries, acute epistaxis is potentially very serious. Sudden and massive epistaxis is usually fatal, and it is one of the most dreaded complications after radiotherapy (RT) among patients with cancer of the head and neck region. To the best of our knowledge, few patients who are alive have been presented with massive epistaxis due to ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm associated with RT in the literature. Herein, we reported a successfully treated massive epistaxis case of ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm associated with RT in a patient who has nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

The women were contacted by telephone invited to participate in the research. Violence against women is seen most frequently in the 20-40 age group. It is seen from this study that the most common physical violence against women mostly occurs among those who have low levels of education and income, are married and have children. It was also found that 7.6 % of patients had received psychiatric support after being subjected to violence. When the educational level increases, the rate of receiving psychiatric support increases. In terms of violence against women, emergency physicians and also wider society should be informed about the extent of the problem, second there is a need for more training in the recognition of violence to women. In addition the reasons for this violence and ways of resolving the problem should be further investigated.",

                abstract: "The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for two-terms mortality in elderly patients with hypoglycemic attack in emergency room (ER). A total of 111 (41 males, 70 females) geriatric patients (>65 years) presented with hypoglycemia during a period of between January 2012 to December 2016 were included to the study. The data were obtained by screening the patients’ records in our hospital, including age, sex, laboratory parameters, co-morbidities, admission time to hospital, admission results, 15-day and 3-month mortality rates. 63.1% of patients had diabetes mellitus (DM), 51.4% of patients were using OAD and 21.6% were using insulin. The blood glucose levels of the patients who died within the first 15 days after admission were lower than the patients who did not die and it was statistically significant (p=0.014). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinin values were significantly higher in patients who died within the first 15 days after admission (p=0.002, p=<0.001). Blood calcium level and platelet (PLT) counts were significantly lower in patients who died within the first 15 days after admission (p=0.006; p=0.001). Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) was significantly higher in patients who died in the first 15 days after admission (p=<0.001). Neutrophile count was significantly higher in both group patients who died within 15 days and 3 months (p=0.002, p=0.012). Lymphocyte count was significantly lower in patients who died within 3 months (p=0.007). The presence of coexisting DM, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HT) and malignancy and to use OAD were statistically significant in patients who died within the first 15 days. We found that lower glucose level, impaired renal function, lower calcium and PLT, increased RDW and neutrophile, lower lymphocyte, coexisting DM, CAD, HT, malignancy and to use OAD are risk factors for mortality of geriatric patients with hypoglycemia.",

The quality of the triage in ES is becoming more of an issue. To reduce crowding in ES, it is necessary to take precautions, hospitalisation should be blocked and priorities should be made and speeded up. Abuse of emergency aid ambulances and their bringing in patients without consultation with the command centre should be hindered, especially geriatric patients should be distributed equally between the hospitals and unjust treatment of the patients should be avoided. It is recommended that geriatric units be established in hospitals and that geriatric ES be evaluated separately. Geriatric patients use mostly emergency aid and the expectancy of their being hospitalised is therefore high; practices should be set up to provide proper care for patients and make home treatment better.",
