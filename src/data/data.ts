                abstract: "Approximately 60% of the adult population experience at least 1 episode of epistaxis in their lifetimes. Because the blood supply of the nasal mucosa ultimately originates from the carotid arteries, acute epistaxis is potentially very serious. Sudden and massive epistaxis is usually fatal, and it is one of the most dreaded complications after radiotherapy (RT) among patients with cancer of the head and neck region. To the best of our knowledge, few patients who are alive have been presented with massive epistaxis due to ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm associated with RT in the literature. Herein, we reported a successfully treated massive epistaxis case of ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm associated with RT in a patient who has nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

The women were contacted by telephone invited to participate in the research. Violence against women is seen most frequently in the 20-40 age group. It is seen from this study that the most common physical violence against women mostly occurs among those who have low levels of education and income, are married and have children. It was also found that 7.6 % of patients had received psychiatric support after being subjected to violence. When the educational level increases, the rate of receiving psychiatric support increases. In terms of violence against women, emergency physicians and also wider society should be informed about the extent of the problem, second there is a need for more training in the recognition of violence to women. In addition the reasons for this violence and ways of resolving the problem should be further investigated.",

Liver injury is the second most common, but the most fatal injury associated with abdomen trauma.

In this study, we searched if we can use IL-33 to show the early stage of kidney injury in diabetic patients. Three groups are identified: 26 patients in Group 1: Healthy group, that do not have any chronic diseases and not taking any medication; 42 patients in Group 2: DM (diabetes mellitus) group without any known kidney disease and with normal kidney functions; 32 patients in Group 3: DM + MA (microalbuminuria) group that are assumed to have nephropathy. IL-33 level of DM patient group is greater than healthy group; also IL-33 level of DM + MA patient group is greater than healthy group; but there is not any difference between DM and DM + MA group. The increase in IL-33 levels in diabetic nephropathy is not associated with kidney injury but the increase could be resulting because of diabetes. So IL-33 cannot be used in early recognition of diabetic nephropathy.",
